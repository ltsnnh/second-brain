General
================================================================================

There is considerable interest in the ARM Cortex platform today because ARM
devices are found everywhere. Units containing ARM devices range from the small
microcontroller embedded systems to cellphones and larger servers running Linux.
Soon, ARM will also be present in higher numbers in the datacenter. These are all good reasons to become familiar with ARM technology.

The device chosen to start this "difficult way" is the STMicroelectronics STM32F103C8T6. It's likely to remain the lowest-cost way for students and
hobbyists alike to explore the ARM Cortex-M3 platform for quite some time. This part number is a mouthful, so let's break it down:

- STM32 (STMicroelectronics platform, implies devices are based upon a 32-bit path)
- F1 (device family)
- 03 (subdivision of the device family, decides the CPU and peripheral capabilities of the device)
- C8T6 (physical manifestation affecting amount of SRAM, flash memory, and so on)

The peripheral support of the STM32F103 is simply amazing when you consider its
price. Peripherals included consist of:

- 4 x 16-bit GPIO Ports (most are 5-volt tolerant)
- 3 x USART (Universal Synchronous/ Asynchronous Receiver/ Transmitter)
- 2 x I:super:`2`C controllers
- 2 x SPI controllers
- 2 x ADC (Analog Digital Converter)
- 2 x DMA (Direct Memory Address controllers)
- 4 x timers
- Watch Dog timers
- 1 x USB controller
- 1 x CAN controller
- 1 x CRC generator
- 20K static RAM
- 64K (or 128K) FLASH memory
- ARM Cortex M3 CPU, max 72 MHz clock

What you learn about the STM32F103 family can be leveraged later in more advanced offerings like the STM32F407.
